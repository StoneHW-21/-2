# Voice Assistant Camera Wearable

Improved my previous [ESP32CAM Semantic Search Wearable](https://github.com/xanderchinxyz/ESP32-CAM-Semantic-Search) by improving the physical design and adding a voice assistant powered by a [local multimodal large language model](https://www.ollama.com/library/moondream) and [Groq](https://groq.com/).

## Demo
